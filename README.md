# Privacy Policy Repository Reference

This document provides information about the Music Note Trainer privacy policy hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Public Repository

This is a separate public repository that hosts the privacy policy for the Music Note Trainer app.

## Live Privacy Policy

**GitHub Pages URL:** https://zeet-apps.github.io/music-notes-trainer-privacy-policy/

This is the live privacy policy page that is submitted to Google Play Console.

## How It Works

1. **Separate Repository**: The privacy policy is hosted in a dedicated public repository to keep it accessible and independent from the main app codebase.

2. **GitHub Pages**: The repository uses GitHub Pages to serve the `index.html` file as a public webpage.

3. **Google Play Requirement**: Google Play requires a publicly accessible privacy policy URL for all apps, especially those targeting children.
