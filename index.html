    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 10, 2024</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and protection of your information when you use the Music Note Trainer app.</p>
    
    <p>We collect minimal personal data and store it locally on your device. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The app may ask for your name to personalize the learning experience. This information is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entered manually by the user</li>
        <li>Stored only on the device using local storage</li>
        <li>Never transmitted or shared externally</li>
        <li>Not sent to any servers or third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use of Data</h2>
    <p>We use the entered name only to personalize the experience (e.g., displaying the user's name on the home screen and tracking lesson progress). No analytics, advertising, or external services collect or access this data.</p>
    
    <p>The app also stores:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lesson completion counts for each level</li>
        <li>User progress data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this data remains on your device and is never shared.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed for children ages 5 and up. We do not knowingly collect any sensitive personal data or data that requires parental consent under laws like COPPA.</p>
    
    <p>The only information requested is the user's name, which stays on the device and is not shared or stored externally. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted personal data inappropriately, please contact us and we will provide guidance on how to remove it from the device.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
    <p>No personal information is shared with third parties or transferred to external servers. All user data remains on the device.</p>
    
    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell or rent your personal information</li>
        <li>Share data with advertisers</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Transmit any data over the internet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the limited data we collect. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. As we store data only on-device using the device's secure local storage, no data is accessible remotely.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The app does not contain external links to third-party websites or services.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using the "Reset Progress" button in the app (logout icon in the top-right corner)</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the app from your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will permanently remove all locally stored data including your name and progress.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. If we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date above. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email: <a href="mailto:zeetforfun@gmail.com">zeetforfun@gmail.com</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data at any time through the app</li>
        <li>Modify your name in the app settings</li>
        <li>Delete all data by resetting progress or uninstalling the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    <p>This app complies with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</li>
        <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
